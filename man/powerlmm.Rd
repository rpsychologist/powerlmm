\title{Power Analysis for Longitudinal Multilevel Models}
\description{
The \pkg{powerlmm} package provides a fast and flexible way to calculate power for
two- and three-level multilevel models with missing data. The focus is on power analysis
for the test of the treatment effect in longitudinally clustered designs,
i.e. where the first level is measurements, and the second level is subjects nested
within a (optional) higher level-three unit, e.g. therapists.
}
\details{
All study designs are specified using the function \code{\link{study_parameters}},
which lets you define your model using familiar notation, either by specifying
the model parameters directly, or by using relative standardized inputs (e.g. \% variance at
each level). Several functions are provided to help you visualize and understand
the implied model, type \code{methods(class="plcp")} to see available methods.
The basic features of the package are also available via an interactive (\pkg{Shiny})
web application, which you can launch by typing \code{shiny_powerlmm()}.

\section{Supported models}{

The purpose of \pkg{powerlmm} is to help design longitudinal treatment studies,
with or without higher-level clustering (e.g. by therapists, groups, or physicians),
and missing data. The main features of the package are:
\itemize{
\item Longitudinal Two- and three-level (nested) linear mixed models,
and partially nested designs
\item Random slopes at the subject- and cluster-level.
\item Account for missing data/dropout.
\item Unbalanced designs (both unequal cluster sizes, and treatment groups).
\item Calculate the design effect, and estimated type I error when the
third-level is ignored.
\item Fast analytical power calculations for all supported designs.
\item Explore bias, Type I error and model misspecification using.
convenient simulation methods
\item Few clusters; accurate power analysis even with very few clusters,
by using Satterthwaite's degrees of freedom approximation.
\item Create power curves to guide power analysis and help with
optimal design of sample sizes at each level.
