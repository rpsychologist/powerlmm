\title{Create an lmer formula based on a \code{\link{study_parameters}}-object}
\usage{
create_lmer_formula(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{study_parameters}}-object containing one study design}

\item{...}{Unused, optional arguments.}
}
\value{
A \code{character} vector with lmer formula syntax.
}
\description{
Create an lmer formula based on a \code{\link{study_parameters}}-object
}
\details{
The lme4 formula will correspond to the model implied by the specified parameters in
the \code{\link{study_parameters}}-object. Thus, if e.g. \code{cor_subject} is \code{NA} or \code{NULL} the
corresponding term is removed from the lmer formula. Parameters that are 0 are retained.

For crossed design if all correlations involving an effect is NA then that random effect will be modeled as uncorelated.


Currently only objects with one study design are supported, i.e. objects with class \code{plcp},
and not \code{plcp_multi}; \code{data.frame} with multiple designs are currently not supported.
