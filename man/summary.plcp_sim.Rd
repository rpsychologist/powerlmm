\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{simulate.plcp}-object}

\item{model}{Indicates which model that should be returned.
Default is \code{NULL} which return results from all model formulas. Can also be a \code{character} matching the
names used in \code{\link{sim_formula_compare}}.}

\item{alpha}{Indicates the significance level. Default is 0.05 (two-tailed),
one-tailed tests are not yet implemented.}

\item{para}{Selects a parameter to return. Default is \code{NULL},
which returns all parameters. If multiple model formulas are compared a named list can be
used to specify different parameters per model.}

\item{...}{Currently not used}

\item{model_selection}{indicates if the summary should be based on a LRT model selection strategy. Default is \code{NULL},
which returns all models, if \code{FW} or \code{BW} a forward or backward model selection strategy is used, see \emph{Details}.}

\item{LRT_alpha}{Indicates the alpha level used if doing LRT model comparisons.}

\value{
Object with class \code{plcp_sim_summary}. It contains
the following output:
\itemize{
 \item \code{parameter} is the name of the coefficient
 \item \code{M_est} is the mean of the estimates taken over all the simulations.
 \item \code{M_se} is the mean estimated standard error taken over all the simulations.
 \item \code{SD_est} is the empirical standard error; i.e. the standard
 deviation of the distribution of the generated estimates.
 \item \code{power} is the empirical power of the Wald Z test, i.e. the proportion
 of simulated p-values < alpha.
 \item \code{power_satt} is the empirical power of the Wald \emph{t} test using
  Satterthwaite's degree of freedom approximation.
 \item \code{satt_NA} is the proportion of Satterthwaite's approximations that failed.
 \item \code{prop_zero} is the proportion of the simulated estimates that
 are zero; only shown for random effects.

\details{
\strong{Model selection}

It is possible to summarize the performance of a data driven model selection strategy
based on the formulas used in the simulation (see \code{\link{sim_formula_compare}}).
The two model selection strategies are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{FW}: Forward selection of the models. Starts with the first model formula and
  compares it with the next formula. Continues until the test of M_i vs M_{i + 1} is non-significant,
  and then picks M_i. Thus if three models are compared, and the comparison of M_1 vs M_2 is non-significant, M_3
  will not be tested and M_1 is the winning model.
 \item \code{BW}: Backward selection of the models. Starts with the last model formula and
  compares it with the previous formula. Continues until the test of M_i vs M_{i - 1} is significant or until
  all adjacent formulas have been compared. Thus if three models are compared, and the comparison of M_3 vs M_2 is non-significant,
  M2 vs M1 will be tested and M2 will be picked if significant, and M1 if not.
}

The model comparison is performed using a likelihood ratio test based the REML criterion. Hence, it assumed you are comparing models
with the same fixed effects, and that one of the models is a reduced version of the other (nested models). The LRT test is done as a
post-processing step, so \code{model_selection} option will not re-run the simulation. This also means that different alpha levels
for the LRTs can be investigated without re-running the simulation.

\strong{Data transformation}

If the data has been transformed \code{sim_formula(data_transform = ...)}, then
true parameter values (\code{theta}s shown in the summary will most likely no longer
apply. Hence, relative bias and CI coverage will be in relation to the original model.
However, the empirical estimates will be summarized correctly, enabling investigation of
power and Type I errors using arbitrary transformations.
