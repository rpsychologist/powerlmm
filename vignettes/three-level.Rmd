This vignette shows how to setup and calculate power for three-level models with nesting in one or both of the treatment arms. 

# Three-level models
Currently, `powerlmm` support three-level models that are fully nested or partially nested; crossed designs are not yet supported. 

## Model formulation
In standard multilevel notation the fully *nested* three-level linear mixed-effects model is
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Level 1}& \notag\\\
Y_{ijk} &= \beta_{0jk} + \beta_{1jk}t_{ijk} + R_{ijk}\\\
\text{Level 2}& \notag\\\
\beta_{0jk} &= \gamma_{00k} + U_{0jk} \\\
\beta_{1jk} &= \gamma_{10k} + U_{1jk} \\\
\text{Level 3}& \notag\\\
\gamma_{00k} &= \delta_{000} + \delta_{001} TX_k + V_{0k} \\\
\gamma_{10k} &= \delta_{100} + \delta_{101} TX_k + V_{1k} \\\
\end{align}
$$
with, 
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
U_{0j} \\\
 U_{1j}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim\mathcal{N}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0 &\\\
0
\end{matrix}
,
\begin{matrix}
 \sigma_{u_0}^2  & \sigma_{u_{01}} \\\
 \sigma_{u_{01}} & \sigma_{u_{1}}^2
\end{matrix}
\right)
,
\end{equation}
$$
and,
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
V_{0k} \\\
 V_{1k} 
\end{pmatrix}
\sim\mathcal{N}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0 &\\\
0
\end{matrix}
,
\begin{matrix}
 \sigma_{v_0}^2  & \sigma_{v_{01}} \\\
 \sigma_{v_{01}} & \sigma_{v_{1}}^2
\end{matrix}
\right)
,
\end{equation}
$$
and
$$
\begin{equation}
R_{ijk} \sim\mathcal{N}(0, ~\sigma_e^2)
\end{equation}
$$

The corresponding arguments in `study_parameters` are

parameter        | `study_parameters()-`argument
---------------- | -----------
$\delta_{000}$   | `fixed_intercept`
$\delta_{001}$   | NA; assumed to be 0
$\delta_{100}$   | `fixed_slope`
$\delta_{101}$   | calculated from `effect_size`
$\sigma_{u_0}$   | `sigma_subject_intercept`
$\sigma_{u_1}$   | `sigma_subject_slope`
$\sigma_{u_{01}}$     | calculated from `cor_subject`
$\sigma_{v_0}$   | `sigma_cluster_intercept`
$\sigma_{v_1}$   | `sigma_cluster_slope`
$\sigma_{v_{01}}$   | calculated from `cor_cluster`
$\sigma_e$         | `sigma_error`

## Standardized and unstandardized formulation

If you are only interested in power of a model, then it is not necessary to define all parameters in the model. For a three-level model power depends on `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, the ratio of subject-level random slope variance to the within-subject error variance (`var_ratio`), and the amount of random slope variance at the third-level (`icc_slope`). Depending on how the effect size in standardized, other paramaters also influence power. If the pretest SD is used as the standardizer, power is influenced by the ratio of the intercept variances to the residual variance (i.e., `icc_pre_subjects`), since the standardization of Cohen's *d* depends on those parameters. 

The relative standardized inputs are calculated in the following way.

Standardized        | Calculation
------------------- | -----------
`icc_pre_subjects`  | $(\sigma_{u_0}^2 + \sigma_{v_0}^2)/(\sigma_{u_0}^2 + \sigma_{v_0}^2 + \sigma_e^2)$  
`icc_pre_clusters`  | $\sigma_{v_0}^2/(\sigma_{u_0}^2 + \sigma_{v_0}^2 + \sigma_e^2)$  
`icc_slope`         | $\sigma_{v_1}^2/(\sigma_{u_1}^2 + \sigma_{v_1}^2)$  
`var_ratio`                | $(\sigma_{u_1}^2 + \sigma_{v_1}^2)/\sigma_e^2$  

Using the argument names in `study_parameters`, the standardized inputs are calculated in the following way. 

Standardized        | Calculation
------------------- | -----------
`icc_pre_subjects`  | `(sigma_subject_intercept^2 + sigma_cluster_intercept^2)/(sigma_subject_intercept^2 + sigma_cluster_intercept^2 + sigma_error^2)`
`icc_pre_clusters`  | `sigma_cluster_intercept^2/(sigma_subject_intercept^2 + sigma_cluster_intercept^2 + sigma_error^2)`
`icc_slope`         | `sigma_custer_slope^2/(sigma_cluster_slope^2 + sigma_subject_slope^2)`
`var_ratio`         | `(sigma_subject_slope^2 + sigma_custer_slope^2)/sigma_error^2`

### Effect sizes
The argument `effect_size` either accepts the raw difference between the groups at posttest, or a standardized effect size by passing the `cohend(...)` function. Cohen's *d* can be calculated using either the pretest, posttest, or random slope SD as the standardizer (denominator). See `?cohend` for options.


For standardized effect sizes that use either the pretest or posttest SD, the effect size refers to the standardized difference between the groups at posttest,
$$\delta_{101} = \frac{\text{ES} \times \sigma}{T_{end}}.$$
Where the standardizer $\sigma$ is one of the following standardizers (based either on the treatment or control groups variance components):

- pretest SD,
$$ \sigma_{pre} = \sqrt{\sigma_{u0}^2 + \sigma_{v0}^2 + \sigma_{e}^2}.$$
- posttest SD,
$$ \sigma_{post} =  \sqrt{\sigma_{u0}^2 + 2T_{end}\sigma_{u01} + T_{end}^2\sigma_{u1}^2 + \sigma_{v0}^2+2T_{end}\sigma_{v01}+T_{end}^2\sigma_{v1}^2 + \sigma_{e}^2}.$$

If the random slope SD (cf. @Raudenbush_Xiao-Feng_2001) is used as the standardizer, the ES now indicate the difference per unit of time, 
$$\delta_{101} = \text{ES} \times \sigma_{slopes},$$
where the standardizer is,
$$ \sigma_{slopes} = \sqrt{\sigma_{u1}^2 + \sigma_{v1}^2}.$$



# Study setup
This example will show  how to calculate power for the `time:treatment`-interaction. We assume that the two treatment arms will differ by a Cohen's *d* of 0.8 at posttest. The treatment period is 11 weeks with weekly measures, and each treatment group has 4 therapists that each treat 10 participants. We are expecting that 5 % of the total slope variance will be at the therapist level, and there will be a moderate amount of heterogeneity in change over time (var_ratio = 0.02), Lastly, 50 % of the baseline variance is at the subject level, and `icc_pre_cluster` is set to 0 since we are randomizing subjects to clusters, and hence there should be no therapist effect at baseline. 

```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 10,
  n3 = 4,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
    )
)
p
```

## Power 
To calculate power for the study, we use the `get_power`-method using the object created with `study_parameters`.
```{r}
get_power(p)
```

### Degrees of freedom
By default `get_power` uses the between-cluster degrees of freedom for three-level models. However, unless sample sizes are large it is probably recommended to use `df = "satterthwaite"`.

## Understanding the model
Several helper functions are available to help you explore the implications of the model's parameters. For instance, we can calculate the variance partitioning coefficients (VPC), to see how the proportion of variance at each level change over time. 

```{r}
get_VPC(p)
```

`between_clusters/100` corresponds to the ICC at level 3 per time point, i.e. the correlation between two subjects belonging to the same cluster. `tot_var` gives the percentage change in variance per time point, compared to the baseline total variance, i.e. at the last time point the total variance is 100 % larger than at baseline. If you want to see the correlation between time points, you can use `get_correlation_matrix(p)`

```{r}
get_correlation_matrix(p)
```

Lastly, a longitudinal study with random slopes implies that the standard deviation per time point follows a quadratic function over time. You can get the model implied standard deviations per time point using `get_sds`.

```{r}
get_sds(p)
```

Since, we defined our study using only standardized inputs, `get_sds` prints the SDs for a default `sigma_error` = 10. At week 10 the SDs will be 20/14 = 1.4 times larger than at baseline. If we used raw values for all parameters defined with `study_parameters`, then these SDs would be the actual model implied
standard deviations per time points. Its useful to check that these values make sense. 

# Compare different values
In a three-level design with random slopes, power depends heavily on the amount of clusters, and `icc_slope` and `var_ratio`. The function `get_power_table` is helpful when you want to compare the effect of up to 3 different parameters.

```{r, fig.width = 8, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
x <- get_power_table(
  p, 
  n2 = 5:20, 
  n3 = c(4, 6, 8, 12), 
  icc_slope = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.1)
)
plot(x) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 240, length.out = 5))
```

The plot shows clearly that including more clusters yields higher power for the same amount of total participants.

# Unbalanced designs
It is possible to define different cluster size both within a treatment and between treatment groups using the `per_treatment` function. Here's an example of how to have more clusters in the treatment group.

```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 10,
  n3 = per_treatment(
    control = 2, 
    treatment = 10
    ),
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD")
)
p
```
Since both treatment arms have the same amount of participants per cluster (`n2`),
the treatment arm will have much more participants. However, we can also use
`per_treatment` to set the number of participants per cluster to be different 
in the two treatment arms. 

```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = per_treatment(
    control = 10,
    treatment = 2
  ),
  n3 = per_treatment(
    control = 2, 
    treatment = 10
  ),
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
p
```
In this example, both treatment arms have 20 participants in total, but different amount of clusters, e.g. therapists.

## Different cluster sizes within a treatment arm
Lastly, we can use the `unequal_clusters`-function to define clusters of varying sizes within a treatment arm.

```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = unequal_clusters(2, 5, 10, 30),
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
p
```
Here we have setup a study that have 4 therapists (clusters) per treatment arm, but 
each therapist are assigned a different amount of subjects (2, 5, 10 and 30 clients, respectively). 
When we use `unequal_clusters` we don't need to specify `n3`. Moreover, `unequal_clusters` can be
combined with `per_treatment`, like so:

```{r}
n2 <- per_treatment(
  control = unequal_clusters(5, 10, 15),
  treatment = unequal_clusters(2, 3, 5, 5, 10, 15, 25)
)
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = n2,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
p
```

## Random cluster sizes
Instead of exactly specifying the numbers of subjects per cluster, we can treat it as a random variable and instead specify
a probability distribution. This is probably preferable, unless it is exactly known how patients will be allocated. Since each power calculation will be based on a different realization of cluster sizes, it is wise to repeatedly calculate power for repeated realization from the distribution of cluster sizes. This is done automatically by adding the argument `R`, the output is then show the expected values by averaging over the realizations. Here's an example using the Poisson distribution.

```{r}
n2 <- unequal_clusters(
  func = rpois(n = 5, lambda = 5)
)
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 3,
  n2 = n2,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
get_power(p, R = 10, progress = FALSE)
```

N.B., in this case cluster sizes are *not* sampled independently for each treatment group, i.e. both groups will have exactly the same cluster imbalance. To sample each group independently, either from the same or from a different distribution, use `per_treatment`.

```{r}
# sample cluster sizes in each treatment group independently
# but from the same distribution
func <- unequal_clusters(
  func = rpois(n = 5, lambda = 5)
)
n2 <- per_treatment(
  control = func, 
  treatment = func
)
```


# Partially nesting
Partially nesting is common in e.g. clinical psychology studies, when a treatment is 
compared to a wait-list control. The wait-list arm will only have two levels, but the
treatment arm will have three-levels, just as in the previous examples. To define a 
partially nested study you just need to add `partially_nested = TRUE`.

```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = unequal_clusters(2, 5, 10, 30),
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  partially_nested = TRUE,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)

p
```

No matter how you define `n2` and `n3`, for a partially nested design `n2` will automatically
be set to the total amount of subjects. Here's two examples

```{r}
p1 <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 5,
  n3 = 5,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  partially_nested = TRUE,                      
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)

p2 <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = per_treatment(
    control = 50, 
    treatment = 5
  ),
  n3 = per_treatment(
    control = 1,
    treatment = 5
  ),
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  partially_nested = TRUE,                      
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)

p1
p2
```

# Missing data
Missing data can be accounted for in the power calculations by the argument `dropout`, which can be added to all the available designs. The missing data is assumed to be monotonically increasing, hence intermittent missing data is not currently supported. Two helper functions are used to define the dropout pattern; either `dropout_manual` or `dropout_weibull`. Here I will use `dropout_weibull`.

```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 10,
  n3 = 5,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0, 
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  dropout = dropout_weibull(
    proportion = 0.3, 
    rate = 1/2
  ),
  fixed_slope = -0.5/10,                      
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)

p
```

Here I've chosen to have a total of 30 % of the participant dropout during the study, with more dropout occurring earlier in the study period. We can plot the model and the missing data pattern using the `plot`-method.

```{r, fig.width=8}
plot(p, type = "dropout")
```

And the power can be calculated using `get_power`.
```{r, message = FALSE}
get_power(p)
```

## Different dropout patterns per treatment group
The helper function `per_treatment` can also be used to define different dropout patterns per treatment arm.
```{r, fig.width=4}
d <- per_treatment(
  control = dropout_weibull(
    proportion = 0.3, 
    rate = 1/2
  ),
  treatment = dropout_weibull(
    proportion = 0.5, 
    rate = 2
  )
)

p2 <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 10,
  n3 = 5,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0, 
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  dropout = d,
  fixed_slope = -0.5/10,                      
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)

plot(p2, type = "dropout")
```

# The design effect and Type I errors if clustering is ignored
You might be interested in calculation the *design effect*. The `get_DEFT`-function will 
calculate the design effect for the standard error of the `time:treatment`-interaction. DEFT tells you
how many times larger the standard errors from the misspecified model should be. It will
also report the approximate Type I error if the random slope at the third level is omitted. Here's an example 
that investigates the impact of increasing cluster sizes on the DEFT.
```{r, message = FALSE}
p2 <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 30),
  n3 = 5,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0, 
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  dropout = dropout_weibull(
    proportion = 0.3, 
    rate = 1/2
  ),
  fixed_slope = -0.5/10,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8, 
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
get_DEFT(p2)
```

We can see that the design effect increases with more subjects per cluster. Even when only 5 % of the slope variance is at the cluster level, Type I errors can be considerably inflated if the random slope at the third-level is ignored.
