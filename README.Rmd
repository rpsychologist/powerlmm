Power Analysis for Longitudinal Multilevel/Linear Mixed-Effects Models.

## Overview
The purpose of `powerlmm` is to help design longitudinal treatment studies (parallel groups), with
or without higher-level clustering (e.g. longitudinally clustered by therapists, 
groups, or physician), and missing data. The main features of the package are:

* Longitudinal two- and three-level (nested) linear mixed-effects models, and partially nested designs.
* Random slopes at the subject- and cluster-level. 
* Missing data.
* Unbalanced designs (both unequal cluster sizes, and treatment groups).
* Design effect, and estimated type I error when the third-level is ignored.
* Fast analytical power calculations for all designs.
* Power for small samples sizes using Satterthwaite's degrees of freedom approximation.
* Explore bias, Type I errors, model misspecification, and LRT model selection 
  using convenient simulation methods.

## Installation
`powerlmm` can be installed from ~CRAN~ and GitHub. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# CRAN, version 0.4.0
# install.packages("powerlmm")

# GitHub, dev version
devtools::install_github("rpsychologist/powerlmm")
```

## Example usage
This is an example of setting up a three-level longitudinal model with random slopes at both the subject- 
and cluster-level, with different missing data patterns per treatment arm. Relative standardized inputs are used,
but unstandardized raw parameters values can also be used. 

```{r three-level-setup, fig.width=9}
library(powerlmm)
d <- per_treatment(
  control = dropout_weibull(0.3, 2),
  treatment = dropout_weibull(0.2, 2)
)
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 10,
  n3 = 5,
  T_end = 10,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  dropout = d,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8,
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
p
```

```{r trend}
plot(p)
```

```{r three-level-power, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_power(p, df = "satterthwaite")
```

## More vizualisations
```{r trends-varying}
plot(
  p,
  RE_level = c(1, 2),
  type = "trend"
)
```
```{r trend-ridges}
plot(
  update(p, n1 = 3),
  RE_level = c(1, 2),
  type = "trend_ridges"
)
```


### Unequal cluster sizes
Unequal cluster sizes is also supported, the cluster sizes can either be random (sampled), or the marginal distribution can be specified. 

```{r three-level-power-unequal, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = unequal_clusters(2, 3, 5, 20),
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(-0.8,
    standardizer = "pretest_SD")
)
get_power(p)
```

Cluster sizes follow a Poisson distribution
```{r three-level-power-unequal-random, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = unequal_clusters(func = rpois(5, 5)), # sample from Poisson
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  icc_pre_cluster = 0,
  icc_slope = 0.05,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8,
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
# expected power by averaging over R realizations
get_power(p, R = 100, progress = FALSE)
```

### Convenience functions
Several convenience functions are also included, e.g. for creating power curves.

```{r three-level-power-curve}
x <- get_power_table(
  p,
  n2 = 5:10,
  n3 = c(4, 8, 12),
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = c(0.5, 0.8),
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  ),
  cores = CORES
)
```

```{r power-curve}
plot(x)
```

## Simulation
The package includes a flexible simulation method that makes it easy to investigate the performance of different models. As an example, let's compare the power difference
between the 2-level LMM with 11 repeated measures, to doing an ANCOVA at posttest. Using `sim_formula` different models can be fit to the same data set during the simulation.
```{r}
p <- study_parameters(
  n1 = 11,
  n2 = 40,
  icc_pre_subject = 0.5,
  cor_subject = -0.4,
  var_ratio = 0.02,
  effect_size = cohend(
    ES = -0.8,
    standardizer = "pretest_SD"
  )
)
# 2-lvl LMM
f0 <- sim_formula("y ~ time + time:treatment + (1 + time | subject)")
# ANCOVA, formulas with no random effects are with using lm()
f1 <- sim_formula("y ~ treatment + pretest",
  data_transform = transform_to_posttest,
  test = "treatment")
f <- sim_formula_compare("LMM" = f0,
  "ANCOVA" = f1)
res <- simulate(
  p,
  nsim = 2000,
  formula = f,
  cores = CORES
)
```

We then summarize the results using `summary`. Let's look specifically at the treatment effects.

```{r}
summary(
  res,
  para = list(
    "LMM" = "time:treatment",
    "ANCOVA" = "treatment"
  )
)
```


We can also look at a specific model, here's the results for the 2-lvl LMM.

```{r}
summary(res, model = "LMM")
```


## Launch interactive web application
The package's basic functionality is also implemented in a Shiny web application, 
aimed at users that are less familiar with R. Launch the application by typing
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(powerlmm)
shiny_powerlmm()
```
